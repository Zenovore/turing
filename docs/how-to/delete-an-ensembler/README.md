# Deleting Ensembler

An ensembler can be deleted. An ensembler only can be deleted if it is not in active use in routers or ensembling jobs. Deleting an ensembler will result in the purging of the related router version, ensembling job, and ensembler metadata from turing database. This action is **irreversible**.
